# Documentation

Documentation regarding the engineering process can be found in the `deliverables` folder. 

# Installation Guide
To install the necessary requirements for the project, please follow the steps below.

## Installing Python
Verify you have Python installed on your machine. The project is compatible with Python `3.10.1`.

If you do not have Python installed, please refer to the official [Python Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Cloning the Repository 
To clone this repository, download and extract the `.zip` project files using the `<Code>` button on the top-right or run the following command in your terminal:
```shell 
git clone https://github.com/SugarStoneMaster/MyMovieList.git
```

## Creating the Virtual Environment 
It's strongly recommended to create a virtual environment for the project and activate it before proceeding. 
Feel free to use any Python package manager to create the virtual environment. However, for a smooth installation of the requirements we recommend you use `pip`. Please refer to [Creating a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment).

You may skip this step, but please keep in mind that doing so could potentially lead to conflicts if you have other projects on your machine. 
## Installing Requirements
To install the requirements, please: 
1. Make sure you have **activated the virtual environment where you installed the project's requirements**. If activated, your terminal, assuming you are using **bash**, should look like the following: ``(name-of-your-virtual-environment) user@user path``

2. Install the project requirements using `pip`:
```shell 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Download & Database Configuration 

Download the [!dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alanvourch/tmdb-movies-daily-updates) and follow the instructions to install and configure ![MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). 

# How to Run 

After downloading, move the dataset to the desired location on your machine. Run the `main.py` script to prepare and load the dataset into your database. 
After that, you can start you application by running the script located at `backend/app.py`.
